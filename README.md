## üåç About The Project

In an era of increasing digitalization and the growing reliance on data servers, the role of sustainable computing becomes paramount. Schneider Electric, a leader in digital transformation and energy management, presents EcoForecast - an innovative challenge to reduce the computing industry's carbon footprint.

Our mission: To predict which European country will have the largest surplus of green energy in the next hour. This knowledge is vital in making strategic decisions to optimize computing tasks with green energy, thereby diminishing CO2 emissions and fostering a sustainable digital future.
